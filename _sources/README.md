# Understanding Machine Learning Methods

This is a repository for my notes and various resources, specifically focusing on machine learning. My primary interest lies in exploring and elucidating areas such as Generative Models and Reinforcement Learning.

## Understanding Diffusion and Score-Based Generative Models

I wrote a small introduction into [Score-Based and Denoising Diffusion Models](https://fema42.github.io/intro_to_diffusion/intro.html). The introduction is written in the form of a jupyter book and based on great resources like:

- **Diffusion-Denoising Models:** For a very good introduction into diffusion models you can check out the blog post from Lilian Weng: [Diffusion-Denoising Models](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/). She also has a great blog posts on a variety of other topics in machine learning. I can highly recommend checking out her blog: [Lilian Weng's Blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/)

- **Score-Based Generative Models** A good introduction is given by Yang Song: [Score-Based Generative Models](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/). There is also a [great talk on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMmqCMwuM2Q) by Yang Song on Diffusion and Score-Based Generative Models.

## Understanding Reinforcement Learning

I have not jet written an introduction into reinforcement learning (RL). However, I list some resources that I found helpful.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) considers sequential decision making problems in a Markov decision processes (MDP). With States $s \in S$, actions $a \in A$, transition dynamics $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$, reward $r(s_t,a_t)$ and if applicable a horizon $T$. A indepth introduction into MDPs is given in [Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

For a more practice oriented introduction into RL i can recomment the following websites:

- [Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! â€” Spinning Up documentation](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)

- [Welcome to the ðŸ¤— Deep Reinforcement Learning Course - Hugging Face Deep RL Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction)

It is also worth checking out different repositories to understanding the implementation of RL algorithms. For example [CleanRL (Clean Implementation of RL Algorithms)](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is doing a great job in providing a clean implementation of RL algorithms. Another great repository is [Stable-Baselines](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) which implements many RL algorithms in PyTorch that are proven to work well.

**Blog Post on debugging RL:**

Debugging RL can be very hard (and frustrating sometimes). I found the following blog post very helpful (and actually also very entertaining): [Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn't Work Yet](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html). Note that the article is from 2018 but I find many points are still valid today and the article is a great read. Another great article on debugging RL is: [Debugging Reinforcement Learning Systems](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html)

**Lecture on RL**
If you want an even more in-depth introduction into RL, I can recommend the following lecture on RL: [CS 285 at UC Berkeley](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

### Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) also considers sequential decision making problems in a Markov decision processes. With States $s \in S$, actions $a \in A$, transition dynamics $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$, reward $r(s_t,a_t)$ and if applicable horizon $T$. Contrary to model free RL we consider having or learning a *dynamics model*, to reason about the world. The dynamics model usually models the environment transition dynamics $s_{t+1}=f_{\psi}(s_t,a_t)$. Hence, the agent can use this dynamics model to decide how to act by predicting the future. Note that the true dynamics are often considered stochastic (that is why we have written $p(\dot)$ above). We can therefore also learn/use a stochastic model of our Environment.

If the model is learnable, the agent can collect more data to improve the model. How the agent uses the model to decide which action to take is based on its approach to planning. The agent can also learn a policy to predict actions (similar to model free RL approaches) to improve its planning based on experiences. Similarly other estimates like inverse dynamics models (mapping from states to actions) or reward models (predicting rewards) can be useful in this framework. One example to planning is [model-predictive control (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control). Where the method optimizes the expected reward by searching the best actions. The actions are sampled for example using a uniformly distributed set, represented as $U(a)$.

You can read more on model-based RL in a blog on [Debugging Deep Model-based Reinforcement Learning Systems](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/debugging-mbrl) and a recent survey on [Model-based Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16712).

### Imitation Learning

Imitation learning (IL) describes methods that learn optimal behavior that is represented by a collection of expert demonstrations. In IL, the agent also interacts with an environment in a sequential decision making process and therefore methods from RL can help to effektively solve IL problems. However, different to the RL-setting, does the agent not receive a reward from the environment. Instead, IL assumes that the experience comes from an expert policy (which behaves perfectly considering the task).  
Therefore, IL can alleviate the problem of designing effective reward functions. This is particularly useful for tasks where demonstrations are more accessible than designing a reward function. One example is to [train traffic agents in a simulation to mimic real-world road users](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9669229). In this case, it is easier to collect demonstrations of real-world road users than to design a reward function that captures all aspects of the task. A great overview of Imitation Learning Methods is given in ["An Algorithmic Perspective on Imitation Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06711). A recent Imitation Learning method is [IQ-Learn](http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/learning-to-imitate/#inverse-q-learning-iq-learn) which is based on soft Q-Learning and learns a Q-function using the demonstration data. The authors showed that there is a one-to-one mapping between the learned Q-function and the underlying reward function and they can sucessfully estimate an reward based on the learned Q-function. We developed a method which does not require actions to be available in the expert data and can be used with state-only demonstrations. The method is called [Imitation Learning by State-Only Distribution Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04332) and uses an expert and environment models to capture the reward function. Another great resource is the repository of [OPOLO: Off-policy Learning from Observations](https://github.com/illidanlab/opolo-code) which implements many IL methods.

### Offline Reinforcement Learning

Similar to RL is Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) a type of RL in which the agent learns from a dataset of previously collected experiences. However in Offline RL the agent learns without interacting with the environment during training. This makes it different from online RL, in which the agent learns while interacting with the environment. In IL both is possible while methods that rely on online interaction generally perform better. While offline RL and imitation learning rely on a dataset of experiences to learn from, they are not the same. While Imitation Learning $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1},)$ assumes that the experience comes from an expert policy (which behaves perfectly considering the task), Offline RL assumes that the experiences come from any policy and often the dataset contains also the Reward of the Environment $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_t)$. So while these methods seem very similar the application of either method should be considered based on the task and availability of the data. For example imitation learning is better suited for the task of learning traffic agents to behave like real-world road users. The reason is that every recorded roas user is by definition an "expert on human driving". However, if the task is to learn to drive a car as safe as possible, then offline RL is probably better suited. The reason is that the dataset of human driving behavior is not necessarily optimal for the task of driving as safe as possible. There is a good article discussing this topic: [Should I Use Offline RL or Imitation Learning?](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2022/04/25/rl-or-bc/). Using Offline RL can help to learn a policy that might be profient in a task before it is deployed in the real-world, where it might be dangerous to learn a policy online. A good overview on Offline RL is given in ["Offline Reinforcement Learning: Tutorial, Review, and Perspectives on Open Problems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01643). Sergey Levin and Aviral Kumar gave a great tutorial at [NeurIPS 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/offlinerltutorial-neurips2020/home) on Offline RL.

## Understanding Numerical Methods

I held the exercises for the course "Numerical Methods for Engineers" at the University of Augsburg, Germany. The exercises are in the Julia programming language. I've made a [jupyter book](https://fema42.github.io/numerical_methods/intro.html) out of the exercises and the exercises itself are availale at: [Numerical Methods for Engineers](https://github.com/FeMa42/auxme_numerik.git) as Jupyter notebooks (partly written in German) with julia code. Many of my exerrcise are based on the great book [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/home.html) by Toby A. Driscoll and Richard J. Braun.
